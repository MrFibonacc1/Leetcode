Key points:


Used dictionary to store head of each array, or key value (important concept) - Good for things like anagrams and 2d arrays

Know how sets work, problem 128 is good.
Either start in the middle and split in half or find the start

for val in dict.values():
    returnVal.append(val) 

dict.values returns all the values in arrays (each key is its own array, key not included)

for strings ask about capitalization, and characters and symbols


Can make 125 cleaner

use process of elimation and dont wait for a concrete answer, have faith (q11)


Linked List:

Can create dummy node reference to start. Initilize like result = ListNode(-1); curr = result;
